# Google-Photos-EXIF-fixer

### Batch fix your EXIF metadata before uploads to Google Photos.

---

## Description

Google Photos doesn't recognize photos with no EXIF metadata and messes around when there's no shooting date in metadata. Using exiftool manually to fix this is pain.

gphotofix is a simple solution. It uses the filename to set shooting date in EXIF metadata. And it does it in batch, yay!
